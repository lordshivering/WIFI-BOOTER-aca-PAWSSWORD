00:00.330 --> 00:05.610
Hello and welcome to my wife I crack and curse and this course we're going to talk about mainly about

00:05.610 --> 00:11.580
cracking Wi-Fi passwords all the attacks that we're going to talk about our practical attacks launched

00:11.910 --> 00:15.830
against actual routers that I have here at my lab.

00:15.930 --> 00:19.560
So all the attacks work and all of them are practical attacks.

00:19.560 --> 00:21.030
They are not theories.

00:21.030 --> 00:22.560
They are not proof of concept.

00:22.590 --> 00:27.960
There are 100 percent work in attacks so these attacks will allow us to obtain the passwords or the

00:27.970 --> 00:37.360
keys for different Wi-Fi networks whether they use the IP or WPA or WPA to encryption.

00:37.440 --> 00:44.650
The cost is divided into three main parts the first part is network basics and this part we're just

00:44.650 --> 00:50.730
going to talk about how networks work how devices communicate with each other and networks.

00:50.780 --> 00:56.380
So and we're going to talk about the interfaces the wireless card and the modes that we can use the

00:56.380 --> 01:02.430
wireless cards and how we can sniff packets that are sent around us in the air.

01:02.640 --> 01:08.460
Once we understand that and we can sniff packets in the air we're going to move to cracking WCP encryption

01:08.460 --> 01:11.970
because it's an easier encryption to crack than WPA.

01:12.180 --> 01:16.820
So we're going to talk about how the EPA works first.

01:16.920 --> 01:22.890
The theory behind cracking it so we're going to talk about the weaknesses in the EPA and then we're

01:22.890 --> 01:29.970
going to discuss three methods to crack the encryption without the need to any connected devices or

01:29.970 --> 01:35.020
without the need to communicate with any of the people who are connected to these devices.

01:36.110 --> 01:40.940
We're not going to explain on the one method because these methods might work or might not work depending

01:40.940 --> 01:45.130
on the distance between you and the wire on the router.

01:45.140 --> 01:50.390
It's going to depend on your wireless card and it's going to depend on the hardware used inside the

01:50.390 --> 01:50.900
router.

01:51.020 --> 01:59.130
So we're going to talk about three methods so that at least one of these methods should work for you.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.580
After we do that we're going to move to WPA.

02:01.600 --> 02:07.350
We're going to again understand how WPA works and what's the difference between the EPA and the EPA.

02:07.480 --> 02:14.320
And what's the weakness in WPA that allow us to crack this encryption WPA and WPA too are similar they

02:14.320 --> 02:16.680
can be cracked using the same methods.

02:16.750 --> 02:21.890
We're going to talk about this into more detail once we move to that part.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.450
Again we're going to talk about four methods to crack WPA.

02:25.450 --> 02:28.960
Going from slow to or quicker methods and cracking and

02:33.010 --> 02:41.380
so as I said before there are three main encryption parts WPP WPA and the two there really is the easiest

02:41.380 --> 02:42.330
one to crack.

02:42.370 --> 02:49.910
It takes minutes to be cracked and it's 100 percent sure that we can actually crack it with WPA.

02:49.910 --> 02:54.550
We're going to have if WPX is enabled then our chances of cracking it is much higher.

02:54.550 --> 02:58.190
So it's around maybe probably around 100 percent to WPA.

02:58.630 --> 03:03.290
If WPX features enabled again more on this once we actually go to WPA.

03:03.290 --> 03:05.680
So this is just an introduction.

03:05.690 --> 03:06.660
Same with WPA.

03:06.650 --> 03:11.390
Two of the rupee has enabled it's very easy to crack if it's not we're going to have to use a dictionary

03:11.390 --> 03:15.330
attack or a wordlist or a rainbow table.

03:15.440 --> 03:19.520
We're going to talk about all of that once we actually got to that section.

03:19.520 --> 03:23.640
So let's go ahead and start with network basics and the next lecture.
